There is 1 single file that is flagged by Anti-Viruses as a virus, however I can assure you that it is NOT.
This file is my personal patch for VEGAS Pro. The script will extract the patch into VEGAS Pro's directory.
The issue is... VEGAS Pro's directory is a protected directory, so when the patch attempts to patch itself into
this directory - it is flagged as a virus. This is false-positive.
I know what I did to create my VEGAS Pro patch and what I put into it... and I'm assuring you for the 2nd time:
There is nothing malicious about this file.

The file in question is my patch that I've made:
"\Installer-files\Installer-Scripts\npt.exe"

PLEASE add this file to your Anti-Virus exclusions/whitelist.
If you're really worried that I'm going to hack you (Lol), shoot me a DM on twitter @NiferEdits.
