Installer Script by Nifer
Follow on Twitter @NiferEdits
This script automatically checks & installs these requirements (if u are missing them):

	- MEGAcmd 		(used to download MEGA.nz files)
	- WinRAR or 7Zip	(used to extract files)
	- Git 4.x 		(used for Auto-updating (optional)

***YOU NEED to have the folder "Installer-files" in the same directory as "Installer Script by Nifer"*** 
Once you've done that, simply run "Installer Script by Nifer"

All downloaded files will be placed in their own folders under the "Installer-files" folder.
After downloading any 3rd party plugin, open the Installer-files folder > Plugins folder > (Plugin)

Troubleshooting:
My Installer won't get passed installing the required software, It keeps asking to close and re-open but never continues
	- Make sure you have extracted the zipped folder, you can extract the files anywhere on your computer.
	- To extract the files, open the zipped folder > Drag and drop the folder "Nifer-Installer-Script-(version)" anywhere on your computer.

My Installer is giving errors during launch, and instantly closes.
	- Try Restarting the Installer to check for the required software.
	- Otherwise, delete entire Installer and all of it's folders. Then re-download or re-extract the files into a new folder, and try again.

When I go to install Vegas Pro, it says it's already installed, it launches the un-installer but gives an error.
	- Manually un-install Vegas Pro through your control panel. Try my installer afterwards.

When I go to install Plugins, the auto installer doesn't patch it correctly and I still have the trial version.
	- Manually patch the plugin yourself, follow the instructions for each plugin.
	- To find plugins downloaded by the script, go to "Installer-files > Plugins" folders

I turned auto-updating off, but now I want to turn it on.
	- Open the Installer Script and go to Settings > Preferences. Toggle the auto-updating preference.

I have both 7zip and WinRAR installed, but I want to use the other archiver for the installer.
	- Open the Installer Script and go to Settings > Preferences. Toggle the Archiving Method preference.

Extra Information (for those that are curious):

This installer is linked to my MEGA.nz Storage and downloads the needed files from my cloud storage.
This means that this script does not need any updating.
You can use this same exact script to Download, Install, Patch Vegas Pro and Plugins.
All I would need to do is update the files in my cloud storage, that the script reads off of.
This includes all future updates for Vegas Pro and Plugins.

Although, I've allowed a feature to auto update the installer script, in case I add any new features into the installer
in the future. This would require Git to be installed, as it is pulling my github repository to check for updates.

This script utilizes MEGAcmd.
MEGAcmd is a command-line program made by MEGA.nz that allows non-interactive scriptable functions.
This means I can utilize MEGAcmd to send requests to my MEGA.nz cloud storage, and download any needed files.
You will also need WinRAR or 7Zip to extract the files.
This script will automatically detect if you have MEGAcmd and WinRAR/7Zip installed.
If you don't have them installed, this script will automatically install them for you.
