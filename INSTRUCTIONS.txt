*** Upon first launching the script, windows will warn you that my script is "from an unknown publisher".
Simply click "More Details > Open Anyway". 
(This is because owning a software license with Microsoft is pretty expensive.. im not paying monthly for that) ***


*** YOU NEED to have the folder "Installer-files" in the same directory as "Installer Script by Nifer" *** 
Once you've done that, simply run "Installer Script by Nifer"

All downloaded files will be placed in their own sub-folders under the "Installer-files" folder.
After downloading any 3rd party plugin, open the Installer-files folder > Plugins folder > (Plugin)

Troubleshooting:
My Installer won't get passed installing the required software, It keeps asking to close and re-open but never continues
	- Make sure you have extracted the zipped folder, you can extract the files anywhere on your computer.
	- To extract: open the zipped folder, drag the folder "Nifer-Installer-Script-(build#)" folder to anywhere on your computer. (ie: Your Desktop)

My Installer is giving errors during launch, and instantly closes.
	- Try Restarting the Installer to check for the required software.
	- Otherwise, delete entire Installer and all of it's folders. Then re-download or re-extract the files into a new folder, and try again.

When I go to install Vegas Pro, it says it's already installed, it launches the un-installer but gives an error.
	- Manually un-install Vegas Pro through your control panel. Try my installer afterwards.

When I go to install Plugins, the auto installer doesn't patch it correctly and I still have the trial version.
	- Manually patch the plugin yourself, follow the instructions for each plugin.
	- Downloaded plugins are located in "Installer-files > Plugins" folder

I turned auto-updating off, but now I want to turn it on.
	- Open the Installer Script and go to Settings > Preferences. Toggle the auto-updating preference.

I have both 7zip and WinRAR installed, but I want to use the other archiver for the installer.
	- Open the Installer Script and go to Settings > Preferences. Toggle the Archiving Method preference.

Extra Information (for those that are curious):

This installer is linked to my Mediafire Storage and downloads the needed files from my storage.
This means that this script does not need any updating.
You can use this same exact script to Download, Install, Patch Vegas Pro and Plugins.
All I would need to do is update the files in my Mediafire Storage, that the script reads off of.
This includes all future updates for Vegas Pro and Plugins.

Although, I've allowed a feature to auto update the installer script, in case I add any new features into the installer
in the future.
