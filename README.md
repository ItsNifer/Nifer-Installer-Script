<h1 align="center">Nifer's Installer Script (NIS)</h1>
<h5 align="center">NIS is a CLI script used to aid in installing various softwares. The goal in this project is to have an *all-in-one* spot for downloading and installing software that the user needs. NIS is dependency free and works on Windows 10 or Windows 11.                                                                                  </p>
