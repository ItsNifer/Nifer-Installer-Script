# Nifer's Installer Script (NIS)
NIS is a CLI script used to aid in installing various softwares. The goal in this project is to have an *all-in-one* spot for downloading and installing software that the user needs.

NIS is dependency free and works on Windows 10 or Windows 11.

## Usage
1. Download the [latest](https://github.com/ItsNifer/Nifer-Installer-Script/releases/latest) update from the releases page.
2. Extract the files from the zipped .rar file (Right click the .rar file > Extract files)
3. Run "Installer Script by Nifer.cmd"
